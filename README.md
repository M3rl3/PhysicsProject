<p> Initial positions of both tanks are set upon run. User can change the direction of projectiles fired by pressing 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', 'e' keys in combination to change the values on their respective axes. Projectile velocities can be set by pressing the numeric keys '1', '2', '3', '4', '5'. Higher key values correspond to faster projectiles. Projectiles are fired using the 'f' key. A new game can be started by pressing the 'n' key, which also randomizes the tank positions. <br/>&nbsp; *all key values indicated above are case sensitive. <p/>
